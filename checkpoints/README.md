# checkpoints
This folder contains some of the various checkpoints that were required for the project.

## `drone-ar`
An exploration of a drone-based augmented reality game. would use a VR headset to control the drone.

## `javaImageProcessing`
Some Java-based image preprocessing in an attempt to get better results from the OpenCV classifier leveraging some general knowledge about the images. This includes the fact that the climbing wall is relatively uniform in color but the climbing holds are colorful, so using saturation as a separating factor.

## `opencv_hack`
A quick hack pulling together an OpenCV classifier. This ended up as the basis for our OpenCV climbing hold classifier.

## `unity_cmake_setup`
Building OpenCV for Unity on MacOS. Partially working but was ultimately abandoned for just working on Windows.

## `TowardsATestablePrototype.md`
Details where we were and what needed to be done with 1 week left of the first term.

This directory contains some of the checkpoints that were required for the project.

# Term 1

## [Documents](https://github.com/patxu/cs98-senior-project#docs) (week 1-4)

## Hack-a-thing Interlude (week 3)

- ### `drone-ar`
An exploration of a drone-based augmented reality game. would use a VR headset to control the drone.

- ### `javaImageProcessing`
Some Java-based image preprocessing in an attempt to get better results from the OpenCV classifier leveraging some general knowledge about the images. This includes the fact that the climbing wall is relatively uniform in color but the climbing holds are colorful, so using saturation as a separating factor.

- ### `opencv_hack`
A quick hack pulling together an OpenCV classifier. This ended up as the basis for our OpenCV climbing hold classifier. See some initial [results](https://github.com/patxu/cs98-senior-project/tree/master/checkpoints/opencv_hack#results).

- ## `unity_cmake_setup`
Building OpenCV for Unity on MacOS. Partially working but was ultimately abandoned for just working on Windows.

## Towards a Testable Prototype (week 9)
- [`TowardsATestablePrototype.md`](https://github.com/patxu/cs98-senior-project/blob/master/checkpoints/TowardsATestablePrototype.md) – where we were and what needed to be done with 1 week left of the first term.

## End of Term User Testing and Demos (week 10)
- [`EndOfTermDemos.md`](https://github.com/patxu/cs98-senior-project/blob/master/checkpoints/EndOfTermDemos.md) – debrief of work completed and work ahead, user testing plan, conclusions, general plan of attack for 17W

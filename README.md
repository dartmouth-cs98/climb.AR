## Overview
An augmented reality climbing game library, with a focus on releasing the platform as a developer-friendly development kit. Components include
- wall, hold, and climber body recognition,
- route generation, and
- hold grabbing detection

to allow developers to build 2D, interactive climbing games via Unity (e.g. [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0ErnsIVzkc), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg2uRGf_04g), [3](http://augmentedclimbing.com/games/)).
